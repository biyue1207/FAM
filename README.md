## 1. Installation
This repository is based on PyTorch 1.11.0, CUDA 11.3 and Python 3.8
```
conda create -n FAM python=3.8
conda activate FAM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 2. Dataset
Data could be got at [ACDC](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS/tree/master/data/ACDC) and [promise12](https://promise12.grand-challenge.org/Download/).

## 3. Pretrained Backbone
Download pre-trained [Swin-Unet](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UC3XOoezeum0uck4KBVGa8osahs6rKUY) model to "./code/pretrained_ckpt" folder.
```
├── ./code/pretrained_ckpt
    └── swin_tiny_patch4_window7_224.pth
```
## 4. Usage
To train a model,
```
python ./code/train.py  # for ACDC training
``` 
To test a model,
```
python ./code/test.py  # for ACDC testing
```
